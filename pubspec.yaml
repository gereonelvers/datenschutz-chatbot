# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/img/
    - assets/fonts/
    - assets/lottie/
    - unity/

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nexa
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nexa-Regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nexa-Light.otf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/Nexa-Bold.otf
          weight: 900
